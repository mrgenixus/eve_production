# Eve Production Mark IV
Yet another attempt to solve a difficult problem I have in eve, that is worth isk, when producing ships for sale

## Other versions
For reference, see [other versions](https://github.com/mrgenixus/eve_production/tags)

This repo uses 'Repo-within-a-repo' technique because using multiple repo's for superceding versions of the same project is just confusing.

As you can see, this problem has thwarted me for some time.
Some might say I lack the programming language to describe it.  ... I think its the smell.

## Setup
  Currently no back-end exists and tesing is being done to try to frame the problem in terms of react/redux

  ```
  npm install
  ```

## Tests

Testing currently uses webpack-mocha, which doesn't suck like Karma.

```
npm test
```
